Outside of school and programming, I spend my days making sandwiches over at **The Melt**.

Check out what [my typical shifts](https://github.com/cieloaloy/cse-110-proj/blob/main/index.md#typically-my-shifts-look-something-like-this) are like, or my takes on [the menu](https://github.com/cieloaloy/cse-110-proj/blob/main/index.md#the-menu).

## Typically, my shifts look something like this:

```
void make_sandwich() {
    assemble();
    cook();
    slice();
    package();
}

int main () {
    while (true) {
        make_sandwich();
        if (my_shift == over) {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
```

Whenever I do a closing shift, I have to complete a checklist that looks similar to the following:

- [x] Turn off the oven
- [ ] Clean the heater
- [ ] Restock the ingredients
- [ ] ...

And so on and so forth. Closing happens between 1 and 3 am, believe it or not.

## The Menu

You can check out the menu [here](https://www.themelt.com/our-menu). There are many options for the whole family, including:

I mean, this grilled cheese sandwich looks pretty good to me!

Personally, my top 3 sandwiches on the menu are:

1. Three Cheese Classic grilled cheese
2. Mac Daddy
3. Steak & Cheese

Hey, I wasn't lying about the grilled cheese looking [good](secret.md). ðŸ‘€

My favorite perk of working here is definitely the food! The menu is really solid and the ingredients are quite high-quality, especially the bread.

Outside of school and programming, I spend my days making sandwiches over at **The Melt**.

> I Love It Here!
> -- Customers

Typically, my shifts look something like this:

```
void make_sandwich() {
    assemble();
    cook();
    slice();
    package();
}

int main () {
    while (true) {
        make_sandwich();
        if (my_shift == over) {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
```

You can check out the menu [here](https://www.themelt.com/our-menu). There are many options for the whole family, including:

- Burgers
- Soups
- Shakes
- Garlic fries
- And more!

I mean, this grilled cheese sandwich looks pretty good to me!

Personally, my top 3 items on the menu are:

1. Three cheese grilled cheese
2. Mac Daddy
3. Steak & Cheese sandwich

Hey, I wasn't lying about the grilled cheese looking good. ðŸ‘€
